barplot

Use when: You want to compare average values (with confidence intervals) across categories.

Example: Average salary by department.

countplot

Use when: You want to count frequency of categories (like a histogram for categories).

Example: Number of students in each class section.

boxplot

Use when: You want to compare distribution & summary statistics (median, IQR, outliers) across categories.

Example: Exam scores by gender.

violinplot

Use when: Same as boxplot, but also want to see the shape/density of distribution.

Example: Income distribution across job types.

stripplot

Use when: Show individual data points along with categories (works best for small datasets).

Example: Marks of each student in two different schools.

swarmplot

Use when: Like stripplot, but avoids overlap by arranging points.

Example: Age of patients grouped by treatment type.

üìà Distribution Plots

histplot

Use when: Show distribution of a single numeric variable (frequency bins).

Example: Distribution of ages in a survey.

kdeplot

Use when: Show a smoothed distribution curve (good for continuous data).

Example: Weight distribution in population.

rugplot

Use when: Show raw data points along an axis (useful for small datasets).

Example: Showing actual values of exam marks under a histogram.

üîó Relationship Plots

scatterplot

Use when: Explore relationship between two numerical variables.

Example: Height vs weight of individuals.

lineplot

Use when: Show trend over continuous variable (often time series).

Example: Stock price over time.

relplot

Use when: High-level interface for scatter/line plots with facets.

Example: Sales vs profit across multiple regions.

üìê Matrix & Heatmaps

heatmap

Use when: Show a matrix of values with colors (great for correlation matrices).

Example: Correlation between exam subjects.

clustermap

Use when: Heatmap + hierarchical clustering (groups similar rows/cols).

Example: Gene expression clustering in biology.

üìö Pair & Joint Plots

pairplot

Use when: Show scatterplots + histograms for multiple numerical variables.

Example: Iris dataset (petal length, petal width, etc.).

jointplot

Use when: Show relationship between two variables with marginal distributions.

Example: Income vs spending score with histograms on sides.
